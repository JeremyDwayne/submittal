# Submittal Builder – Project Context

This is an Electron-based desktop application designed for control panel integrators who need to create submittal packages. The purpose of the app is to combine existing cut sheet PDFs into a single, ordered submittal document based on a Bill of Materials (BOM).

## App Behavior

- The user uploads:
  - A **CSV file** representing the BOM, with columns:
    - `manufacturer`
    - `part_number`
  - A **folder of existing PDF cut sheets**

- The app scans the filenames in the PDF folder and attempts to match each BOM line item to a PDF file.

## Matching Rules

- A file is considered a match if:
  - The **filename contains both** the `manufacturer` and `part_number`
  - Matching is **case-insensitive**
  - Ignores **dashes**, **underscores**, and **file extensions**

## Features

- Show a status table: ✅ matched, ❌ not found
- Allow **manual overrides**: User can manually select a file for unmatched parts
- Combine matched PDFs into one final **`Submittal.pdf`**
- Let the user choose an output directory
- Optionally: Export/import session as a `.json` file for later editing

## Tech Stack

- Electron (main process)
- React (renderer process)
- Node.js filesystem, `pdf-lib` or `pdf-merger-js` for PDF handling

## File Structure (Simplified)
